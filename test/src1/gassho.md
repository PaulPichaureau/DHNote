A position used for greeting, with the palms together and fingers pointing upwards in prayer position; used in various Buddhist traditions, but also used in numerous cultures throughout Asia. It expresses greeting, request, thankfulness, reverence and prayer. Also considered a mudra or inkei of Japanese Shingon. See also: Añjali Mudrā, Namaste, Sampeah and Wai. Shaolin monks use half a gassho using only one arm to greet. In Japan, it is used not only during rituals concerning Buddhism but also as a gesture to appease the opposite party when making apologies or asking for permission or favors. In addition, there are cases where a person greets them during a greeting before and after a meal, which is a custom derived from Buddhism. In Shinto, they clap hands together as hands, but then lower their hands, bow and worship (in Shinto worship, they do not share hands)..
